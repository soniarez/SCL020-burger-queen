This platform considers two users: waiters and kitchen staff (chef).

#### User story 1: Waiter/waitress should be able to take customer order

2. Add products to the order.
3. Delete products.

6. It looks and works well on a tablet.

2. Mark the orders that have been prepared and are ready to be served.
